# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Conditional

This repository demonstrates a simple Python function that produces a `ZeroDivisionError` in an unexpected way. The error is triggered only when a specific condition is met within the function.

The goal is to highlight how seemingly innocuous code structures can still lead to runtime exceptions and how effective testing and defensive programming can help catch them.
